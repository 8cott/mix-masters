//         <p>Covid-19 brought much of the world to a hault, especially in metropolitan areas such as New York City. Little did we know, the silver lining would be an age of innovation and creativity, specifically in the realm of food and drink. Considering the shutdown of businesses and public activites came early in the year 2020, and in the shadow of the 2019 holiday season, some of us had New Year's resolutions to eat right and regain the physiques we all covet once the weather was warm enough to show it off. However, while drinking would be curtailed on any diet regimen, it seemed that making tasty libations while not breaking the dietary bank was an optimal project! This is the spawning of Keto Cocktails and the birth of Mix Masters. We have carefully hand crafted each drink and ensured that recipes were thorough and clear, so that if anyone wishes to recreate these guilt-free cocktails, they can! Now that we have the knowledge of full-stack web applications and software development, we can bring our delicious body of work to the world! While Keto Cocktails are the backbone of Mix Masters, the possibilities are endless with this interactive tool; users can cereate their own drink recipes, save it to the site, and keep record of each drink they post. This will aid in idea sharing and grow the cocktail industry so that homemade mixologists can be the next hit at any party of gathering! Social distancing might be a way of the past, but Mix Masters is the wave of the future!</p>
//         <p>Here are a few things about Mix Masters:</p>
//         <ul>
//           <li>We are brining unique cocktail menues to the world- low sugar/carb "Keto Cocktails", as well as others</li>
//           <li>The main objective is to bring everyone together through idea-sharing, starting with the web application interface and culminating by fleshing them out at social gatherings. Just find the cocktail recipe that best suites the theme of whichever party you're going to and with the help of Mix Masters, you'll be the hit of the night! </li>
//           <li>Ingredients are brand-specific, so while some substitutions might work very well, change the recipe at your own discretion- Mix Masters cannot guarantee that the modified drink will be to the quality standard that they have set for themselves.</li>
